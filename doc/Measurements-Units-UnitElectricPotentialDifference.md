Measurements\Units\UnitElectricPotentialDifference
===============

The `UnitElectricPotentialDifference` class encapsulates units of measure for electric potential difference.

You typically use instances of `UnitElectricPotentialDifference` to represent specific quantities of electric potential difference using the `Measurement` class.

Electric potential difference is the amount of electric potential energy of a point charge at a point in space.
The SI unit for electric potential difference is the volt (V), which is derived as the difference in electric potential energy between two points of a linear conductor when an electric current of one ampere dissipates one watt of power between those points (1V = 1W/1A).

The base unit of `UnitElectricPotentialDifference` is defined as volts.
