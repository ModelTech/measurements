Measurements\Units\UnitRadioactivity
===============

The `UnitRadioactivity` class encapsulates units of measure for radioactivity.

You typically use instances of `UnitRadioactivity` to represent specific quantities of radioactivity using the `Measurement` class.

Radioactivity is the process by which the nucleus of an atom emits radiation.
The SI unit of measure for radioactivity is the becquerel (Bq), which is defined as the quantity of radioactive material in which one nucleus decays per second (1 Bq = 1 s-1).
Radioactivity is also commonly described in terms of curies (Ci), a unit defined relative to the decay of one gram of the radium-226 isotope (1 Ci = 3.7 Ã— 1010 Bq).

The base unit of `UnitRadioactivity` is defined as becquerel.
